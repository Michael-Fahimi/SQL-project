This program operates on the famous World database. Performs tasks are as follows:
1. Retrieve all the attributes of tables Country, City, and Country Language and display them in
the dropdown menus designed for the SELECT, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses.
2. Implement the executeQuery() method, which is executed when the submit button is
clicked. In this method, establish a secure connection to the database and execute the query.
It's important to note that users are only required to select/enter clauses for the SELECT and
FROM parts of the query; other clauses are optional.

The program is tested through the random selection of tables, attributes, and clauses, as shown
below:
• TEST CASE 1: SELECT-FROM (one table).

• TEST CASE 2: SELECT-FROM (more than one table).

• TEST CASE 3: SELECT-FROM (one table)-WHERE (one simple condition)

• TEST CASE 4: SELECT-FROM(more than one table)-WHERE (one simple/multiple

condition)

• TEST CASE 5: SELECT-FROM (more than one table)-WHERE (one simple/multiple
condition)

• TEST CASE 6: SELECT-FROM-WHERE-GROUP BY. (Any combination of tables and
condition is possible)

• TEST CASE 7: SELECT-FROM-WHERE-GROUP BY-HAVING. (Any combination of tables
and condition is possible)

• TEST CASE 8: SELECT-FROM-WHERE-ORDER BY. (Any combination of tables and
condition is possible. Any selection of the order direction is possible)

• TEST CASE 9: SELECT-FROM-WHERE-ORDER BY-LIMIT and/or OFFSET. (Any
combination of tables and condition is possible. Any selection of the order direction is
possible)

• TEST CASE 9: SELECT-FROM-WHERE-ORDER BY-LIMIT and/or OFFSET. (Any
combination of tables and condition is possible. Any selection of the order direction is
possible)

• TEST CASE 10: SELECT-FROM-WHERE-GROUP BY- HAVING-ORDER BY-LIMIT-OFFSET.
(Any combination of attributes, tables and conditions is possible. Any selection of the
order direction is possible)
